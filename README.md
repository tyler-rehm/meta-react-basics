# React Basics Course - Coursera

Welcome to the **React Basics** course repository! This repository contains all the code and project files I completed while following the [React Basics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/react-basics) course on Coursera. The course provides a fundamental understanding of React, its core concepts, and how to build interactive user interfaces efficiently.
